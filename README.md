# RFID Sample Projects Repository

This repository contains sample projects for working with RFID technology. RFID, or radio-frequency identification, is a technology that uses radio waves to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. It has a wide range of applications, from inventory management to access control systems.

The projects in this repository are intended to serve as examples and starting points for developers who want to work with RFID.
